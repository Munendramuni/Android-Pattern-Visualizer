A visual representation of every unique pattern possible on a traditional Android 3x3 lock screen.

The _Random_ mode gives a screensaver worthy animation of all the patterns in a random sequence.

A _Sequential_ mode is also provided to help demonstrate how the patterns were actually generated using depth-first search.
